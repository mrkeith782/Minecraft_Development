# Minecraft Development

Welcome to my Minecraft Development repo.

Most of the stuff that I'm placing here is for my future reference, in order to help me learn some of things that are necessary for spigot development. I'm steadily updating this with more things that I learn. My first plugin is called `TetrisBattles`. Sadly, it does not actually implement Tetris, but that's something to steadily work on!

tetris.java implements most of my executors.

tetrisCommandExe.java implements my initial development for commands.
tetrisBroadcast.java implements my initial development for global broadcasts and sending formatted messages to players.
tetrisHome.java implements my first time working with HashMaps. I also pass a HashMap, named homes into this file.

tetrisShotgun.java implements a shotgun and a railgun. This was for dealing with player location and 3 dimensional vectors (which, ironically, actually helped with my Vector Calculus class!).
tetrisLeaderboard.java will implement a scoreboard. No idea what the scoreboard will contain yet, but we'll see!
